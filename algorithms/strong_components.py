# Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components (SCCs)
# 1. reverse G edges... G(V,E) => G'(V,E')
# 2. DFS on G' to determine source ordering
# 3. DFS on G using step 2's ordering produces SCCs

# graph = {vertex: (inbound edges, outbound edges)} (could have used a list to
# be consistent)
# vertex = an index digit
# edge = a tuple of the vertices incident on the key vertex
